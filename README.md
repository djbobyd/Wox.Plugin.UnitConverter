# Wox.Plugin.Units
A very crude and ugly, but working version of a Wox plugin for converting from one unit to another.
I made it just for me, but I will be happy if this helps someone else as well. 
As it is not visible in the plugin manager of Wox the only way to install it currently is to drag and drop the .wox file onto the Wox UI.

Usage:

Just start writing: <quantity> <from unit> in <to unit>
It is possible to use full names as well as abbreviations.

Examples:

5 Kilogram in Gram

3,2 kg in g

52,4 SquareInch in SquareMeter
